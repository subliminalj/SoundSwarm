Sound Bath prognosis: GOOD
This app aims to replicate the mind melting of a sonic sound bath.
Select multiple audio sources to play at the same time and abide transfixed in glorious audio mud.

Usage!

Prerelease version only plays sounds in the edit mode. To play sounds, tap Edit Node, then tap the play button. Back out of the Edit view and scroll down to other nodes. Tap edit and then play to play other sounds. To stop a sound from playing, tap the Play button again so it says off.

There is an intent for loading sounds from the SDCard or google drive, but so far it doesn't load sound files properly.
